      <description>Article link - Why Machine Learning is more Practical than Econometrics in the Real World
I came across this article in the R-bloggers subcription. It is a great source to keep updated with any latest R packages and tutorials.
My undergraduate had several Econometrics courses and my first serious thought about what I want to do for my career came from it. The way that Econometrics unfolds the inferences and indications of important variables greatly interested me.</description>

      <description>Seriously, this is my first post, not a theme sample post that I forgot to delete. I think the second best title for this post would be I am watching you. I know it sounds creepy and may make you feel uncomfortable, but I&amp;rsquo;m just telling the truth.
I guess for many of you who come to my site and seeing this post already know Google Analytics. It is a tool for tracking the website behavior and you should blame Google not me for feeling being stalked.</description>
