      <description>Seriously, this is my first post, not a theme sample post that I forgot to delete. I think the second best title for this post would be I am watching you. I know it sounds creepy and may make you feel uncomfortable, but I&amp;rsquo;m just telling the truth.
I guess for many of you who come to my site and seeing this post already know Google Analytics. It is a tool to track the website behavior and you should blame Google not me for feeling being tracked.</description>
