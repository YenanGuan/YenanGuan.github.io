            <p>Seriously, this is my first post, not a theme sample post that I forgot to delete.
<br>I think the second best title for this post would be <strong>I am watching you</strong>.
<br>I know it sounds creepy and may make you feel uncomfortable, but I&rsquo;m just telling the truth.</p>

<p>I guess for many of you who come to my site and seeing this post already know Google Analytics. It is a tool to track the website behavior and you should blame Google not me for feeling being tracked.
<br> This website is built with Hugo and Github Pages. I was surprised to find that many Hugo themes have a built-in feature to allow you easily assert your Google Analytics ID and just after a second you will be able to see your site browser behavior metrics.</p>

<p>A lot of my daily works have things to do with Google Analytics (GA). It does feel different between when I work with GA of a company account, and when I&rsquo;m just curious about who&rsquo;s coming to my site with my own account - I HAVE TO know who is behind each single number.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I know, for now. Only me and my boyfriend.
<br>He is Cambodian and was home for holiday when I asked him to check my new website. We always argue about iOS and Android after he changed his iPhone into Samsung.</p>

<p>But then, some numbers caught my eye.</p>

<p><center><img src="/post/my_first_post/empty_metrics.jpg" alt="empty_metrics" /></center>
<br>
<br>
<center><img src="/post/my_first_post/samsung1.jpg" alt="empty_metrics" /></center></p>

<p>Well..
<br>Something&rsquo;s going wrong.
<br>If this happened in work setting, I would definitely regard the data as junks and get rid of them before doing any analysis. But this time, I know that a real person is behind the 100% bounce rate and 00:00:00 session duration.
<br>I need to know what&rsquo;s happening because that does contradict to my domain knowledge and the next time when I clean GA data, I will not feel comfortable anymore when cleaning the junks which I <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s a junk.
<br>I know I have biased opinion towards Android and Samsung, but I still Googled &ldquo;Google Analytics not tracking Samsung Internet&rdquo;. No one&rsquo;s talking about that. Emm.. Then I asked my boyfriend whether he visited the website with any Samsung specific private mode or using anything special to protect his identity. &ldquo;Nope&rdquo;. Then he told me that he had the same problem when he was developing his internship company&rsquo;s website. Emm..
<br>Roadblocked for a few minutes and then he shot me messages again.
- &ldquo;Maybe my browser stricts cookies and tracking. Oh right. I use AdBlock. Maybe affect&rdquo;. - &ldquo;Is it for Android? or Samsung?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Samsung browser can install that as an extra.&rdquo;</p>

<p><center><img src="/post/my_first_post/adblock.jpg" alt="empty_metrics" /></center></p>

<p>The &ldquo;1&rdquo; near that icon means there&rsquo;s one tracking that it blocks, which in my case is my GA.</p>

<p><center><img src="/post/my_first_post/pp2.jpg" alt="empty_metrics" /></center></p>

<p>I asked him to unblock and got it fixed! Wait.. So besides the two empty tracking you came to my site twice and total session duration is 12s so you come here and only stay for 6s each?? If the next time I ask you to help me double check something and I&rsquo;m only seeing you stay for 6s and pretend to read through the whole thing I will get mad at you how can you treat me so carelessly&hellip;
<br>Stop!! I think I will let him turn on Ad blocker on again to protect his privacy.</p>

<p>Wow. This is how a few numbers are taking control of my night. How data is unfolding one&rsquo;s attitude towards his privacy, towards his work, and towards a couple&rsquo;s relationship. And this is just a story when I know the few numbers are produced by only two people.</p>

<p>Then I see from GA Realtime report that my site is having a Taiwan user.
<br>And I suddenly remember that I forgot to turn off my VPN to Taiwan after my Bilibili anime time.
<br>Data knows me better than myself. o.O</p>

<p>As the first post of my personal website, I hope it will keep reminding me of</p>

<ol>
<li>I choose analytics as my career is because I love how it tells stories, and there&rsquo;s a big world out there</li>
<li>Always be careful about choosing the way I deal with data without making arbitrary decisions</li>
<li>Keep privacy protection in mind</li>
</ol>

<p>Welcome myself to my personal website. ðŸ’ƒ</p>
